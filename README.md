## Description 
For this weeks homework we use all our knowledge as full stack web developers to create a MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js) application that uses the Google Books api to search for books. the main goal of this web application is to be able to search for a book that is in googles search index, be presented with simplified information on that book and be given the ability to save the book. the user can then also go into the saved page and be presented with the same information but on only the book the user saved. the user can click the link button to view the official google books page or press the delete button once they are done with said book. the Application is hosted on Heroku and uses a mongoDB Atlast online database
